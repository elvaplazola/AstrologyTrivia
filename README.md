Astrology Trivia Game

A simple trivia game with beginner-advanced astrology questions. 

Some issues I ran into- 
I had a lot of difficulties with the score keeping aspect. Through trial an error I was finally able to get the score to update after every question but then it would add points regardless of whether or not the correct answer was chosen. I was eventually able to fix the bugs to ensure my game runs properly and when working on the CSS I ran into the issue where I had to figure out a way to change the button color when the correct/incorrect answer was chosen. Unfortunately I was unable to fix that bug but I am overall satisfied with the functionality.
